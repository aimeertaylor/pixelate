Description: Pixelate spatially continuous predictions as per their averaged uncertainties. 
             In brief, the function pixelate groups point estimates into a specified
             number of large pixels; computes the average uncertainty within each large
             pixel; then, for each large pixel, depending on its average uncertainty,
             either averages the point estimates across it or across smaller pixels nested
             within it. The resulting plot of pixelated spatial predictions is deliberately and
             selectively pixelated, similar to a photo that is pixelated to disguise a
             personâ€™s identity. Areas of high average uncertainty in the pixelated plot
             are unresolved, while areas with low average uncertainty are resolved,
             similar to information poor versus rich regions of a satellite map.
