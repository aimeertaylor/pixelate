Description: Pixelate and plot point estimates as per their averaged uncertainties. 
    Let a dot denote a set of coordinates associated with a point estimate and its uncertainty, 
    which is represented by a single value, e.g. the width of the estimate's credible interval.
    Let a pixel refer to a square or rectangle comprising one or more dots.  
    Uncertainties are averaged over a limited number of large pixels (many dots per pixel). 
    Average uncertainties are classified as high, intermediate or low. 
    If the average uncertainty is high, point estimates plotted within the large pixel are averaged. 
    If the average uncertainty is intermediate, point estimates plotted within the large pixel are 
    averaged over smaller pixels (fewer dots per pixel) that are nested within the large pixel.
    There may be one or more intermediate classifications, corresponding to one or more nested pixel sizes. 
    If the average uncertainty is low, point estimates are not averaged.
