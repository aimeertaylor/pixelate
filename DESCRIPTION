Description: Pixelate spatially continuous predictions as per their average uncertainty.
    The package pixelate centres around a single function also called pixelate.
    The function pixelate groups predictions into a specified number of large
    pixels; computes the average uncertainty within each large pixel; then, for
    each large pixel, depending on its average uncertainty, either averages the
    predictions across it or across smaller pixels nested within it. The averaged
    predictions can then be plotted. The resulting plot of averaged predictions
    is selectively pixelated, similar to a photo that is deliberately pixelated
    to disguise a personâ€™s identity. Areas of high average uncertainty in the
    pixelated plot are unresolved, while areas with high average certainty are
    resolved, similar to information poor versus rich regions of a satellite map.
