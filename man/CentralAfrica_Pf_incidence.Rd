\format{An data frame with 270083 observations and four variables:
\describe{
  \item{x}{Longitude in decimal degrees}
  \item{y}{Latitude in decimal degrees}
  \item{z}{Median predicted incidence at location x y}
  \item{u}{Width of the 95\% predicted incidence credible interval at location x y}

These data are available at the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) website \url{https://map.ox.ac.uk/}.
   Specifically, they were obtained by selecting
   'ANNUAL MEAN OF PF INCIDENCE' at \url{https://map.ox.ac.uk/malaria-burden-data-download/}.

\description{
\emph{P. falciparum} predicted all-age incidence (clinical cases per 1,000 population per annum)
in 2017 for central Africa at 2.5 arcminute (approximately 5km) resolution [1].
}
\details{
The median and credible interval were computed using samples from a posterior
predictive simulation that approximated the joint posterior predictive
distribution thereby accounting for spatial covariance [1,2].
