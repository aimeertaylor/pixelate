\title{Pixelate as per average uncertainty}
\usage{
pixelate(dot_matrix, num_pix_xy_bigk = 20, bigk = 3L,
  scale = "linear", scale_factor = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{dot_matrix}{Data frame. Supplies dot coordinates, point estimates and
credible interval bounds; see example data (once added).}

\item{num_pix_xy_bigk}{Integer vector length two. Specifies the number of large
pixels (bigk-th pixel size) in the x and y direction}

\item{bigk}{Integer. Specifies the number of different uncertainity classes and
thus pixel sizes.}

\item{scale}{String equal to either "linear" or "exponential". Specifies
whether to scale pixel sizes (in units of dots) from class k = 2,...,bigk
linearly or exponentially}

\item{scale_factor}{Integer. Specifies a factor by which to either multiply
or exponentiate pixel sizes (in units of dots), depending on the scale.}
}
\value{
List. The list contains the original and expanded dot matrices
  complete with pixelated point estimates (variable Pix_z); bigk+1 quantiles of
  the distribution of average uncertainties used to classify average
  uncertainties; Dots per pixel for k = 1,...,bigk pixel sizes in the x and y
  direction; the dot matrix dimensions (in dots); and a matrix of dot
  memberships (the index of the pixel each dot belongs to for k = 1,...,bigk
  pixel sizes).

\description{
Pixelate point estimates as per their average uncertainties.
}
\details{
This is a wrapper function which, given a dot matrix and several arguements,
pixelates as follows. Note that, if there are few point estimates, many
combinations of arguments (if not all) will fail. Let a dot denote a set of
coordinates associated with a point estimate and its uncertainty, which is
represented by a single value, e.g. the width of the estimate's credible
interval. Let a pixel refer to a square or rectangle comprising one or more
dots. Uncertainties are averaged over a limited number of large pixels (bigk-th
pixel size, many dots per pixel). Average uncertainties are classified as
high, medium (with one or more subdivisions if argument bigk exceeds three), or
low. If the average uncertainty is high, point estimates within the large
pixel are averaged. If the average uncertainty is intermediate, point
estimates within the large pixel are averaged over smaller pixels (fewer dots
per pixel) that are nested within the large pixel. There are bigk-2 nested pixel
sizes in total. If the average uncertainty is low, point estimates are not
averaged.
